  <p> The headless cow beat the henhouse at midnight yesterday. </p>
  <hr />
  <p> There was a man named Bubba and Bubba knew EVERYONE in the whole world!!! Once when Bubba got a new job, Bubba says to his new boss, "Boss, I know everyone in the whole world!" His boss doesn't believe him, so he says "No you do not know everyone in the whole world" but Bubba says "Yes I do!" so Bubba's boss says "Well prove it!" then Bubba says "Pick someone... and I know them!" Well Bubba's boss thinks for a minute and then comes up with a name. "Tom Selleck! I bet you don't know Tom Selleck!" Bubba says "Tom Selleck! Tom and I were in boy scouts together when we were kids!" but Bubba's boss says "No you weren't!" then Bubba says "Yes we were!" so they fly to Hollywood and drive up to Tom Selleck's house. Bubba knocks on the door and Tom Selleck answers and Bubba goes "Tom!!!" and Tom goes "Bubba!" and they hug and catch up for 30 minutes and Bubba's boss can't believe it. But then he thinks "Well that could happen, it's just one person," so he tells Bubba and Bubba says "OK, pick somebody else!" This time Bubba's boss has someone in mind! "The president, Bill Clinton! You don't know President Bill Clinton!" but Bubba says "Oh yes I do! Bill and I were on debate team together in college!" Bubba's boss says "No you weren't!" and Bubba says "Yes we were!" so they fly to Washington and they catch with the President at a press conference. They work their way through the crowd until Bubba gets close enough to catch Clinton's eye and waves "Bill!" and the President waves "Bubba!" and after the press conference they hug and catch up for 30 minutes and Bubba's boss is stunned-- he can't believe it. But then he thinks "Well that's just two people in one country--that doesn't mean he knows everyone in the whole world!" so he tells Bubba and Bubba says "OK, pick someone out of the world spectrum and I know them!" And Bubba's boss knows just who to pick so he says "The Pope! You do not know the Pope!" and Bubba says "The Pope! The Pope BAPTISED me!" and Bubba's boss says "No he didn't!" and Bubba says "Yes he did!" so they fly to Rome where the Pope is giving Mass in front of hundreds of thousands of people. They work their way through the crowd-- without much luck-- so Bubba says "Boss, were never gonna get there together through all these people so I tell you what--I'll work my way up there and when I do, I'll give you a sign that shows you I know the Pope!" and he leaves. Well Bubba's boss waits and waits and waits and just when he's about to give up, he sees the Pope come out onto the balcony and right there beside is Bubba! Shortly afterwards, Bubba's boss passes out. Bubba comes back and finds his boss passed out and he fans him and says "Boss! Boss! Wake up!" and when his boss comes to, he asks "Boss, what happened?" Bubba's boss looks at Bubba and says "OK, I can see Tom Selleck. I can see Bill Clinton... heck, I can even take the Pope! But when somebody standing next to me asks 'Who's that up there with Bubba?' that's a little more than I can take!" </p>

  <p> If IBM made toasters... They would want one big toaster where people bring bread to be submitted for overnight toasting. IBM would claim a worldwide market for five, maybe six toasters.<br />If Microsoft made toasters... Every time you bought a loaf of bread, you would have to buy a toaster. You wouldn't have to take the toaster, but you'd still have to pay for it anyway. Toaster'95 would weigh 15000 pounds (hence requiring a reinforced steel countertop), draw enough electricity to power a small city, take up 95% of the space in your kitchen, would claim to be the first toaster that let's you control how light or dark you want your toast to be, and would secretly interrogate your other appliances to find out who made them. Everyone would hate Microsoft toasters, but nonetheless would buy them since most of the good bread only works with their toasters.<br />If Apple made toasters... It would do everything the Microsoft toaster does, but 5 years earlier.<br />If Fisher Price made toasters... "Baby's First Toaster" would have a hand-crank that you turn to 
toast the bread that pops up like a Jack-in-the-box.<br />If The Rand Corporation made toasters... It would be a large, perfectly smooth and seamless black cube. Every morning there would be a piece of toast on top of it. Their service department would have an unlisted phone number, and the blueprints for the box would be highly classified government documents. The X-Files would have an episode about it.<br />If the NSA made toasters... Your toaster would have a secret trap door that only the NSA could access in case they needed to get at your toast for reasons of national security.<br />Does DEC still make toasters?... They made good toasters in the '70s, didn't they?<br />If Hewlett-Packard made toasters… They would market the Reverse Polish Toaster, which takes in toast and gives you regular bread.<br />If Sony made toasters... Their Personal Toasting Device, which would be barely larger than the single piece of bread it is meant to toast, can be conveniently attached to your belt.<br />If the Franklin Mint made toasters... Every month, you would receive another lovely hand-crafted piece of your authentic hand-crafted Civil War pewter toaster.<br />If Cray made toasters... They would cost $16 million but would be faster than any other single-slice toaster in the world.<br />If Thinking Machines made toasters... You would be able to toast 64,000 thousand pieces of bread at the same time.<br />If Timex made toasters... They would be cheap and small quartz-crystal wrist toasters that take a licking and keep on toasting.<br />If Radio Shack made toasters... The staff would sell you a toaster, but not know anything about it. Or you could buy all the parts to build your own toaster.<br />If K-Tel sold toasters... They would not be available in stores, and you would get a free set of Ginsu knives.<br />If the PQ made toasters... They wouldn't want to be on the same counter-top as the rest of the appliances. </p>

You get time off for good behavior. <br />AT WORK...You get rewarded for good behavior with more work. <br />IN PRISON... A guard locks and unlocks all the doors for you. <br />AT WORK...You must carry around a security card and unlock and open all the doors yourself. <br />IN PRISON... You can watch TV and play games. <br />AT WORK... You get fired for watching TV and playing games. <br />IN PRISON... You get your own toilet. <br />AT WORK... You have to share. <br />IN PRISON...They allow your family and friends to visit. <br />AT WORK... You cannot even speak to your family and friends. <br />IN PRISON... All expenses are paid by taxpayers with no work required. <br />AT WORK...You get to pay all the expenses to go to work and then they deduct taxes from your salary to pay for prisoners. <br />IN PRISON... You spend most of your life looking through bars from the inside wanting to get out. <br />AT WORK...You spend most of your time wanting to get out and go inside bars. <br />IN PRISON...

The Perfect Employee? <br />
1 Bob Smith, my assistant programmer, can always be found <br />
2 hard at work at his desk. He works independantly, without <br />
3 wasting company time talking to colleagues. Bob never <br />
4 thinks twice about assisting fellow employees, and always <br />
5 finishes given assignments on time. Often he takes extended <br />
6 measures to complete his work, sometimes skipping coffee <br />
7 breaks. Bob is a dedicated individual who has absolutely no <br />
8 vanity in spite of his high accomplishments and profound <br />
9 knowledge in his field. I firmly believe that Bob can be <br />
10 classed as an asset employee, the type which cannot be <br />
11 dispensed with. Consequently, I duly recommend that Bob be <br />
12 promoted to executive management, and a proposal will be <br />
13 executed as soon as possible. <br />
Addendum: <br />
That idiot was standing over my shoulder while I wrote the report sent to you earlier today. Kindly re-read only the odd numbered lines.

  <p> How many ???s does it take to change a lightbulb? <br />
Bowser: “I will kidnap the light bulb and hold it for a ransom of gold coins!” <br />
Ludwig: Just one, but it will explode soon after installation. <br />
Ludwig: “My new invention, the Super Mega Lighter-Upper, will make all lightbulbs obsolete! Now just let me turn it on and-“ BOOM! <br />
Ludwig: Approximately one point zero zero zero zero… <br />
Roy: None. He can fight in the dark. <br />
Lemmy: Two. One to change the bulb and the other to write a story about it and put it in his Land. <br />
Iggy: He can’t see without his glasses anyways… <br />
Larry: Two. One to change the bulb and the other to kill the first one and take the credit. <br />
Wendy: “I’ll just scream for Lemmy to do it while my nails dry.” <br />
Wendy: Just one. She holds the bulb and the universe revolves around her. <br />
Morton: Just one, but it sounds like fifty. <br />
Podoboo: They ARE the light bulb. <br />
Kamek: Just one, but no one knows what he will change it into. <br />
Wario: Three. One to steal a new one, one to change it, and the third to sell the old one as new. <br />
Goomba: How can they? They don’t have hands! <br />
Toad: Five. Four to make a tower and one to stand on the top one’s shoulders and change the bulb. <br />
Luigi: How would you even get him into that dark room? <br />
Mario: None. He’s that good. <br />
Star Spirit: Just one, but someone has to wish for it to be changed first. </p>

  <p> I knew a dog who was so stupid he chased bones and buried cars! </p>

  <p> A man got a new job driving a school bus. When he went to pick up the keys, the man behind the desk slammed them down and said, "Bus #1. Has a Big Bird picture on the side."<br />

The man got in his bus and drove to the first stop. He picked up one boy, who immediately introduced himself. "Hi! My name is Ross, and I'm special." Ross took a seat in the front row.<br />

At the next stop, the bus driver picked up another young boy who also introduced himself. "Hi! My name is Reese, and I'm special." Reese got on and took a seat next to Ross.<br />

At the next stop, the bus driver sees the largest girl he's ever seen. She gets on. "Hi! My name is Patty." She takes a seat in the back of the bus.<br />

The bus driver can't believe his eyes at the next stop. This girl makes Patty look like Tinkerbell. She gets on, and to his surprise, the gigantic girl also says, "Hi! My name is Patty."<br />

The route continues after that without anything remarkable happening. Except that when they arrive at school, he looks back and notices that Ross and Reese have taken their shoes off and they're picking at each other's feet. "What are you doing?" the bus driver asks. "We're here! Put your shoes back on!"<br />

At the end of the day, the bus driver takes all of the kids home. When he pulls into the bus depot, he slams the keys down on the counter and says, "I quit!"<br />

The manager is flabbergasted. "But why?"<br />

The bus driver responds, "Two obese Pattys, special Ross, special Reese, picking bunions on a Sesame Street bus!"

  <p> There is a fly hovering over a lake.<br />

In the lake, there is a fish staring at the fly and thinks, "If that fly drops an inch, I can have lunch."<br />

There is a bear on the shore, staring at the fish and thinks, "If that fly drops an inch, the fish will get the fly and I'll catch the fish. Then I can have lunch."<br />

There is a hunter in the woods, watching all of this and thinks, "If that fly drops an inch, the fish will get the fly, the bear will get the fish, and I shoot the bear and then I can have lunch."<br />

There is a mouse behind the hunter watching all of this and thinks, "If that fly drops an inch, the fish will get the fly, the bear will get the fish, the hunter will shoot the bear, and that piece of cheese in the hunter's pocket will fall and then I can have lunch."<br />

There is a cat hiding behind the mouse and thinks, "If that fly drops an inch, the fish will get the fly, the bear will get the fish, the hunter will shoot the bear, the cheese will fall, the mouse will get the cheese and I can get the mouse, so then I can have lunch."<br />

Well it happens, the fly drops an inch, the fish gets the fly, the bear gets the fish, the hunter shoots the bear, the cheese falls out of the hunters pocket, the mouse gets the cheese and right as the cat is about to get the mouse the mouse runs away and the cat ends up in the lake.<br />

Moral of the story: If the fly drops an inch, there is going to be a wet cat. </p>
