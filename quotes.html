  <h1> "Yeah, whatever."
"Enough about you, let's talk about me, Johnny Bravo."
"I am Johnny Bravo, the one-man army!"
"Wanna see me comb my hair, really fast?"
"Hey there smart momma, typin' recipes?"
"I bet your name's Mickey, 'cause you're so fine. You're so fine you..."
"But these letters! If Santa doesn't get these letters by tonight, I might not get all those free presents I asked for. And who ever heard of a Christmas without free stuff?"
"Great Scott. My pizza-sense is tingling."
"Do the Monkey with me"
"Mmm. Frosted Sugar Bits. The great taste of frosted sugar in bits."
"Sweet. Bring on the Danish chicks and cream soda."
"Now remember, I do my best work when I'm being worshiped as a god."
"Mama mia. That's a spicy meatball!."
"Hey, Santa, it's me, Johnny. Remember I'm the one that beat you up last year 'cause I thought you were a burglar?"
"But enough about me... Let's talk about me. What do you think of me?"
"Hey! How come he gets a banana?"
"Hey Foxy Mama, You smell kinda pretty. Wanna smell me? Hoohah!"
"I am investigating the disappearance of all the cats in the city... my living room is full of cats... that means..." (pause) "I'm hungry!"
"Pops? It's me, Johnny! I couldn't find any donuts so I brought some tile grout!"
"You know, you'd think a person with that much hate in her heart wouldn't gravitate towards the service industry."
"Dog... donkey... Well, they both start with the letter "N"..."
"Check the pects. hoo ha hooah!"
"Whoa! A castle in the sky! Just like in that fairy tale of Little Red Rumplestiltskin and the Three Bears and Gretel!"
"Whaddaya mean? I got the hamster wheel and the hamster food dispenser. (looks in the mirror) Oh no! She's turnin' me into a beautiful butterfly!"
"Mister, I don't think you realize who you're talking to. I'm Johnny Bravo, the one-man army!"
"Wanna watch my chest hair move in slow motion?"
"Man, I'm pretty."
"Whoa, Mama!"
"This won't end well." (whenever Johnny is about to take a beating)
"You know, that just might be crazy enough to work."
"If loving me is wrong, you don't wanna be right!"
(Looks in mirror)"Wait, who's that handsome guy?" (Dials phone) "Hello, 911 emergency? There's a handsome guy in my house" Oh, wait, cancel that. It's only me."
"Hey baby, can I be your natural selection?"
"This is not good... for my hair!"
(whenever someone corrects him) "Right, what did I say?"
"Aaaah. The great smell of pig!"
"No Mama! I'm too old for the tiny pants!!"
"Work?! (Screams in horror)"
"(After a random story) And then my pants fell down."
"I came, I saw, I broke a hip."
"I may be late honey, but I'm looking good."
"He did it!"
"Wiggy!"
"4%? That's almost 5%"
"20,000$? That`s almost 20,000$!"
"Space. It's really, really, really, really big."
"If all you boys and girls will clap real hard, Johnny can make bail! Get me the Lawyer Fairy!"
"Oh yeah! Who's the fairy, who's the fairy?! (Dances then quickly stops) You didn't see that, did you?"
"Bad baby! Stop defying the laws of physics!"
"Neighbor kid help! Witch's curse shrank me! Cops chasing me! I live with my mom! NO MOTIVATING GOALS!!!"
"Some people look at Jerky an say,"Why?". Me, I look at Jerky and I say "Mmmmmmmm! Jerky!"
"Jinkies? Isn't that a breakfast cereal?"
"You know, that reminds me of a funny story. I was washing my head in the toilet the other day, when-- (After some time) So when the battery ran out, I realized I had my underwear over my head, the whole time! (Laughs) "
(Johnny and Carl crash on a seemingly deserted island and were separated) "Guess Carl didn't make it. I'll miss the little fella. (short pause) Oh, well. Can't mourn forever!"
"Four feet good! Two feet bad!"
"It's a beautiful day. But not as beautiful as me."
"(to Talky Tabitha) Now listen Raggedy Evil! You better stop..(Talky Tabitha throws Johnny against the wall)
"The Beach is that way." (Holds up arm and points to show off his muscles)
"This is gettin' really old really fast."
"Hey babearilla, that a pretty eensie-weensie, teeny-weenie polka-dot thingy you got going there."
[eating ice cream with a toothache] "Chomp, chomp, chomp, AAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY TOOTH! THE PAIN! THE HORRIBLE PAIN! Mmmmmmmm, creamy! Chomp, Chomp, Chomp, AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!! THE STABBING KNIVES OF PAIN! Hey! It's got nuts in it!"
"AAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!! MONSTERS FROM THE ID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Oh, you will pay for this!"

"Do the Monkey with me"
"Mmm. Frosted Sugar Bits. The great taste of frosted sugar in bits."
"Sweet. Bring on the Danish chicks and cream soda."

"Mama mia. That's a spicy meatball!."
"Hey, Santa, it's me, Johnny. Remember I'm the one that beat you up last year 'cause I thought you were a burglar?"

"Mister, I don't think you realize who you're talking to. I'm Johnny Bravo, the one-man army!"
"Wanna watch my chest hair move in slow motion?"
"Man, I'm pretty."
"Whoa, Mama!"
"This won't end well." (whenever Johnny is about to take a beating)
"You know, that just might be crazy enough to work."
"If loving me is wrong, you don't wanna be right!"
(Looks in mirror)"Wait, who's that handsome guy?" (Dials phone) "Hello, 911 emergency? There's a handsome guy in my house" Oh, wait, cancel that. It's only me."
"Hey baby, can I be your natural selection?"
